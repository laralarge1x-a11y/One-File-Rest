# Elite Tok Club Portal

A full-stack platform for managing TikTok account violation appeals, enabling creators and shop owners to track cases, communicate with support, manage evidence, and use AI for drafting appeals.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite (port 5000), framer-motion for animations, custom dark-theme design system
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (port 3000)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit built-in)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Auth**: Discord OAuth 2.0 via Passport.js
- **AI**: Groq SDK (optional — requires GROQ_API_KEY)
- **Bot Bridge**: Discord.js (optional — separate service)

## Key Features

- **Client intake** — `/cases/new` is a 7-step wizard (Violations → Purchase →
  Prior Appeals → Verification → Metrics → Plan → Review). Progress is
  autosaved to localStorage (`newcase-wizard-v2`). Screenshots are uploaded as
  data URLs to `/api/evidence` after the case is created. Plans:
  `basic_guard`, `fortnightly_defense`, `proshield_creator` — selection
  persists onto `users.plan` (only when previously empty).
- **Client case view** — `/cases/:id` shows a status callout, tabbed
  Timeline / Evidence / Messages, sticky right-side facts panel, and a real
  REST `POST /api/messages` form. Live updates via socket events
  `message:new` and `case:status_changed`.
- **Notifications** — `services/notifications.ts` writes a row in
  `notifications` and emits `notification:new` to the user's socket room
  (`user:<discord_id>`). Triggered on case status change, won/denied, and
  staff replies. Frontend `<NotificationBell />` lives in `CustomerNav`,
  joins its own socket, shows a badge + dropdown + toast.
  Endpoints: `GET /api/notifications`, `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read`,
  `POST /api/notifications/read-all`.
- **Admin Case Workspace** — `/admin/cases` and `/admin/cases/:id` render
  `CaseWorkspace.tsx`, a 3-zone view: case list (left), tabbed detail
  (Overview / Evidence / Messages / Notes / History) with status + priority
  dropdowns, and an AI side panel (right) showing `AISummaryPanel` +
  compliance score.
- **Needs Attention queue** — `GET /api/admin/needs-attention` returns three
  buckets (deadlines < 24 h, stale > 48 h, unreplied > 12 h). Surfaced at
  the top of `AdminDashboard`.
- **Shared widgets** — `components/case/CaseTimeline.tsx` (vertical or
  horizontal stage list, falls back to a status-derived skeleton) and
  `components/case/AISummaryPanel.tsx` (per-case in-memory cache; POSTs to
  `/api/ai/case-summary`).

## Running the App

The workflow runs both services concurrently:
```
cd One-File-Rest && npx concurrently "tsx server/index.ts" "cd client && npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000"
```

## Required Environment Variables

To enable full functionality, set these secrets:
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` — Discord app client ID
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` — Discord app client secret
- `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` — OAuth callback URL (e.g. `https://your-domain/auth/callback`)
- `GROQ_API_KEY` — Groq API key for AI features
- `CLOUDINARY_URL` — Cloudinary for evidence file uploads (optional)
- `BOT_TOKEN` — Discord bot token for the bot bridge (optional)
- `OWNER_DISCORD_IDS` — Comma-separated Discord IDs to seed as owners

## Key Features

1. Discord OAuth authentication with role-based access (client, support, case_manager, owner)
2. Case management for TikTok violations with deadline tracking
3. Real-time messaging between clients and staff (mirrored to Discord)
4. AI-powered appeal draft generation via Groq (7 endpoints: generate-appeal, analyze-violation, analyze-image, bulk-analyze, case-summary, enhance-template, policy-explainer)
5. Evidence upload and analysis via Cloudinary
6. Admin dashboard with analytics and staff management
7. Policy alerts and compliance scoring

## Customer UI Redesign (May 2026)

Premium dark-theme customer portal redesign:
- `client/src/styles/design-system.css` — design tokens (colors, spacing, radii,
  shadows, motion), dark scrollbar, blob/shimmer/shake keyframes, and
  `.field` / `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost` / `.page-wrap` utilities. Imported
  in `main.tsx`.
- 8 shared components in `components/customer/` exported via `index.ts`.
  `GlassCard` is the canonical interactive container — when given `onClick`
  it auto-applies `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, and Enter/Space key handling.
- 6 customer pages rewritten: Login (split layout + animated blob),
  Dashboard (greeting, plan card with glow, animated counters, recent cases),
  NewCase (3-step wizard with floating labels and drag-drop file picker),
  Cases (filter pills + status-bar cards, route `/cases`), CaseDetail
  (two-column desktop, deadline countdown, evidence grid with lightbox,
  sticky chat panel), Messages (list + thread with mobile slide).
- `App.tsx` wraps customer routes in `AnimatePresence` + `PageTransition` +
  `ToastProvider`, with `CustomerNav` (top) + `BottomNav` (mobile) layout.
- `message:new` socket events are normalized defensively in CaseDetail and
  Messages to handle both snake_case (`sender_discord_id`, `created_at`) and
  camelCase (`senderDiscordId`, `timestamp`) shapes the server emits, and
  filter out events for other cases by `case_id`/`caseId`.
- Evidence uploads in NewCase are local-only previews — the backend has no
  client-side upload endpoint, so the UI clearly tells users files will be
  attached afterwards in their Discord case channel.

## Mobile Admin App (Task #3, May 2026)

Native Android APK that wraps the existing admin portal via Capacitor 6.
Source lives in `One-File-Rest/mobile/` (gitignored `android/` + `www/`
generated at build time on a workstation — Android SDK is NOT available in
the Replit container).

- **Capacitor config** — `mobile/capacitor.config.ts`, appId
  `club.elitetok.admin`. `server.url` defaults to the deployed Replit URL
  so a normal `vite build` + redeploy ships UI changes to staff phones on
  next open.
- **Plugins** — push-notifications (FCM), native-biometric, camera,
  send-intent, browser, app, splash, status-bar, badge.
- **Build scripts** (root `package.json`): `pnpm run build:android`
  (debug APK), `pnpm run build:android:release` (signed APK + AAB),
  `pnpm run android:open`, `pnpm run android:run`. All require Android
  Studio + JDK 17 on the workstation.
- **Native bridge** — `client/src/lib/native.ts` exposes `isNative()`,
  biometric unlock, FCM init + deep-link, hardware back, share intent,
  camera, badge count. Every plugin import goes through `nativeImport()`
  (variable-indirected `import()`) so Vite never tries to resolve them at
  web build time.
- **App wiring** — `client/src/hooks/useNativeBridge.ts` is called from
  `App.tsx`; on native+staff it does biometric → FCM register → back-button
  → share-intent → app-resume badge refresh. Non-staff users on native
  hit the `pages/StaffOnly.tsx` screen.
- **Server** — new `device_tokens` table (FCM tokens per staff/device),
  `services/fcm.ts` (Legacy HTTP API sender, gated on
  `FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY`), `routes/devices.ts` (mounted at
  `/api/devices`, staff-only). `createNotification()` now fans every
  notification to socket + web push + FCM.
- **Required secret**: `FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY` (FCM Legacy server key).
  Without it, FCM sends are silent no-ops; everything else still works.
- **Docs**: `MOBILE.md` (architecture, dev/release/keystore/secret
  rotation), `mobile/README.md` (workstation setup), `mobile/resources/`
  (icon + splash source).

## Verification Status (last full audit)

Server boots clean with formatted ✅/⚠️ env checklist for every required & optional var, prints all 84 registered routes on startup, and gates protected endpoints (401 without auth, 302 on OAuth, 200 on /health and public /api/policies).

- **22 admin endpoints** mounted under `/api/admin/*`: stats, activity, alerts, cases (+/:id), clients (+/:id, /portal-link, /regenerate-token, /revoke, /message), notes, assign, staff (GET/POST + /:id DELETE), webhook-logs, test-webhook, export/cases, system-stats, env-status, weekly-report, policy-alerts (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE).
- **7 AI endpoints** under `/api/ai/*`. analyze-image accepts `{ base64, mimeType }` and returns `{ analysis: { detected, severity, policy_section, recommendation, appeal_likelihood } }` — frontend Image Analyzer tab matches this exact contract.
- **10 admin pages** all use shared `AdminSidebar` via `AdminLayout` and call real APIs (no mock data).
- **Bot bridge** under `/bot/*`: users/sync, users/:id, users/by-channel/:channelId (reverse lookup), users/:id/revoke, cases (+/:id), cases/create, messages/receive, channels, health.
- **Audit log writes** in: auth (admin_login, client_login), webhook service, botbridge (plan_granted, plan_revoked, user_synced), cases (case_created, case_updated), messages (message_sent), evidence (evidence_uploaded), broadcast (broadcast_sent), admin (case_assigned, note_added, staff_added, staff_removed, access_revoked).
